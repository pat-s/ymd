New submission

Package was archived on CRAN

CRAN repository db overrides:
  X-CRAN-Comment: Archived on 2024-07-31 as check problems were not
    corrected despite reminders.

The package was archived on CRAN due to the underlying Rust code
calling non-API entry points in R. This issue has now been resolved.
We apologize for not addressing this before the July 31, 2024 deadline.
